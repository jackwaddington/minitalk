This might be my favourate project of Hive - to get two programs to talk to each other.

I had to look beyond each letter - to each stroke of your pen on the page, and when you deliver the page to me I will confirm it's receipt.

So that I can the strokes of your pen, I build a special tool called a 'print_bin'.

Late nights into mornings I watched each pen strong being passed one at a time to me, where at my end I pieced then back into messages.
